%h1 API Documentation

:markdown
  This documentation is intended for developers wishing to build integration solutions on top of the Mobile Forms platform. If you would like more general purpose documentation please visit [Device Magic Documentation](http://docs.devicemagic.com). 

  For more complex solutions, we offer an API and set of integration points that developers can easily tap into. These comprise the [HTTP Connector](http-connector) and the [Push API](push-api).

  Using these two APIs, developers can build complex workflow and routing applications integrated into their current back-office systems. Best of all, the mobility aspects are all handled by the platform leaving you free to focus on the business challenge.
