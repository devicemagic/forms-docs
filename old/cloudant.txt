Cloudant Add-on
===========
Cloudant is a distributed CouchDB service. You can use it just like you would standalone CouchDB but you have the added advantage of your data being redundantly distributed over multiple machines.

Local setup
-----------
Since CouchDB and Cloudant have the same REST API you can use them the same way. You just need a http client to interface with the database and a JSON parser.

In the simplest case you can just use the rest-client and json gems:

	$ sudo gem install rest-client json
	
If you don't already have CouchDB on your local machine:

OSX:

	$ brew install couchdb
	
Ubuntu:

	$ sudo apt-get install couchdb

Using from Sinatra
------------------

The following code will GET the specified document from the "music" database and then print it to the page:

	DB = "#{ENV['CLOUDANT_URL']}/music"

	get "/doc/:doc" do
		doc = RestClient.get("#{DB}/#{params[:doc]}")
		@result = JSON.parse(doc)
		haml :doc_id
	end

The view would look something like:

	%h1 A Doc from CouchDB!
	- @result.each do |k,v|
		%b=k
		%em=v
		%br

You would request this page by pointing your browser to:

	http://SOMEAPP.heroku.com/doc/YOURDOCUMENT

Deploying to Heroku
