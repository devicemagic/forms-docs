Deploying Rails Apps
====================

Heroku supports all versions of Rails, from 2.0 through 3.0.  Using the [Bamboo Stack](/bamboo) and manually specifying your rails version through [gem config](/gems) is the easiest way to deploy your app.  For specific information on each version, see below.

Rails 2.3.5 and earlier
-----------------------

Rails 2.3.5 and earlier should work on any of the Heroku [stacks](/stack).  

If you are using other gems, there is a chance that due to a dependency issue your app may run into issues starting.  Please see [this docs page](/rails236) for specific guidance on how to resolve the issue.


Rails 2.3.6 and later
---------------------

Rails 2.3.6 and later only work on the [Bamboo Stack](/bamboo).  Rails 2.3.6+ are incompatible with [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/) 1.0, which is installed on Aspen.  The stacks are specifically created to introduce later versions.  Bamboo runs a newer version and compatible version of Thin.  

To prevent issues, Heroku will reject a push if it detects that you are trying to install a Rails 2.3.6+ app onto Aspen.  If you had previously specified a custom version of thin to run on Aspen, remove the thin gem from your [.gems/Gemfile](/gems), and [migrate your app to Bamboo](http://docs.heroku.com/stack#migrating-between-stacks).

Rails 3
-------

Rails 3 is supported on the [Bamboo stack](/bamboo).  See our [Rails 3](/rails3) docs page for specific notes on using Rails 3 on Heroku.
