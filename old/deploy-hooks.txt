Deploy Hooks
============

Deploy hooks allows you to receive a notification whenever a new version of your app is pushed to Heroku. It's useful to keep you and your team informed about deploys, while it can also be used to integrate different systems together.

After one or more hooks are setup, git push will show their activation right after the app is launched:

    :::term
    $ git push heroku master
    ...
    
    -----> Heroku receiving push
    -----> Rails app detected
           Compiled slug size is 76K
    -----> Launching...... done
           http://myapp.heroku.com deployed to Heroku
    
    -----> Running email hook... done
    -----> Running IRC hook... done

Each deploy hook is it's own addon.  This allows you to pick and choose one or more that you want.  The deploy hooks include:

Email
-----

This hook will send one or more emails. You can specify the subject and body, as follows:

    :::term
    $ heroku addons:add deployhooks:email \
        recipient=me@example.com \
        subject="Myapp Deployed" \
        body="{{user}} deployed app"
    Adding deployhooks:email to myapp...Done.

Email multiple recipients by adding additional email addresses separated by spaces.

IRC
---

An IRC bot will connect to the specified server and message the room.

    :::term
    $ heroku addons:add deployhooks:irc \
        server=irc.freenode.net \
        room=devlounge \
        nick=mydeploybot \
        password=secret \
        message="{{user}} deployed app"
    Adding deployhooks:irc to myapp...Done.

Nick and password are optional. You can also set the server port by sending port=1234.

Basecamp
--------

This hook will post a message to any Basecamp account you specify, under a certain project and post category (both specified by the name).

    :::term
    $ heroku addons:add deployhooks:basecamp \
        url=http://myaccount.basecamphq.com \
        username=deploybot \
        password=secret \
        project=myapp \
        category=deploys \
        title="{{user}} deployed myapp" \
        body="check it at {{url}}"
    Adding deployhooks:basecamp to myapp...Done.

Campfire
--------

Have any Campfire room receive an automated message when your app is pushed.

    :::term
    $ heroku addons:add deployhooks:campfire \
        url=mycampfiresubdomain \
        ssl=1 \
        api_key=0000000 \
        room=devlounge \
        message="{{user}} deployed myapp"
    Adding deployhooks:campfire to myapp...Done.

HTTP Post Hook
--------------

Performs an HTTP post to URL of your choice.

    :::term
    $ heroku addons:add deployhooks:http \
        url=http://example.org
    Adding deployhooks:http to myapp...Done.

Customizing messages
--------------------

It's possible to use variables when defining the message, title or subject of any deploy hook attribute.

For instance, use {{user}} when you want to see who deployed, and that text will be replaced for the actual user email whenever a hook is executed.

Available variables are:

* **app**: the app name
* **user**: email of the user deploying the app
* **url**: the app URL (http://myapp.heroku.com or http://mydomain.com if you have custom domains enabled)
* **head**: short identifier of the latest commit (first seven bytes of the SHA1 git object name)
* **head_long**: full identifier of the latest commit
* **git_log**: log of commits between this deploy and the last
