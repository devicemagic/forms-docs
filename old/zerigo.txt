Zerigo DNS add-on
=================

[Zerigo](http://www.zerigo.com/) provides an excellent [DNS service](http://www.zerigo.com/managed-dns) that is fully integrated with Heroku via the Zerigo DNS add-on.  

Configure DNS servers for your domain
-------------------------------------

Before you can use the add-on, you will need to do a one-time setup for your domain with your registrar, configuring it to use [Zerigo's DNS servers](http://www.zerigo.com/managed-dns/technical_specs):

    a.ns.zerigo.net
    b.ns.zerigo.net
    c.ns.zerigo.net
    d.ns.zerigo.net
    e.ns.zerigo.net

Now you can use these domains with any of your Heroku apps by way of the Zerigo DNS Add-on.


NOTE: DNS changes can take time to propagate across the Internet. On Unix systems, you can verify that your domain is correctly pointed at Zerigo's servers by running "dig ns yourdomain.com" in the shell. You should see the five servers above listed in the output. 


Install the add-on
------------------

The [Custom Domains](http://addons.heroku.com/custom_domains) is a prerequisite for using the Zerigo DNS add-on. The Custom Domains add-on is needed to inform Heroku's [Routing Mesh](http://heroku.com/how/architecture#routing-mesh) of where to send incoming requests for a specific custom domain name. If you haven't already, install it first:

    :::term
    $ heroku addons:add custom_domains:basic
    Installing custom_domains:basic into myapp...done.

All you need to do now is choose one of the [available Zerigo DNS plans](http://addons.heroku.com/zerigo_dns), and install the appropriate add-on. Here's an example using the free version:

    :::term
    $ heroku addons:add zerigo_dns:basic
    Installing zerigo_dns:basic into myapp...done.


NOTE: If you already have the Custom Domains add-on installed when adding the Zerigo DNS add-on, DNS entries for your existing custom domain names will automatically be added to Zerigo's systems.


Add & remove domain names
-------------------------

Once installed, any domain names added or removed via the heroku command-line tool will automatically be added to Zerigo's globally distributed DNS servers.  Updates happen instantly and Heroku will always keep your DNS records correct, meaning you never need to worry about them again. For example:

    :::term
    $ heroku domains:add foo.mydomain.com

This will automatically add a CNAME pointing "foo.mydomain.com" to "proxy.heroku.com". The process for adding the root domain is identical:

    :::term
    $ heroku domains:add mydomain.com
	
In this case, multiple A Records pointing to all the current Heroku front-end IPs will be added since the root domain cannot be aliased with CNAMEs.

Of course, you can also remove a domain name at any time with:

    :::term
    $ heroku domains:remove foo.mydomain.com


Managing MX and other host records
----------------------------------

If your domain is handling mail, you will need to manage your MX Records. The Zerigo DNS add-on provides support for this by allowing you access to Zerigo's web based management interface. Here's how you use it:

1.	Go to the [My Apps page](https://api.heroku.com/myapps).
2.	Locate your app, and click on "General Info".
3.	Use the add-ons menu on the upper right, and select the Zerigo DNS add-on.
4.	Once on the add-on page, click the "Configure" for the domain you'd like to manage.

Clicking "Configure" will automatically sign you in to the Zerigo DNS management interface. In there, you have full control to manage your MX Records.

From the Zerigo management interface you can also add, edit and delete CNAME and A Records. We do strongly recommend that you let Heroku manage entries added via the Heroku command-line client.
