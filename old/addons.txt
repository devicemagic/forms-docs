Add-ons
=======

Extra features for your Heroku app are available as add-ons.  Some add-ons are free and others have a flat monthly cost, but all require that you verify your account by registering your billing information with us.  (We only collect this information as a way to help manage abuse.  We won't charge your card without your explicit authorization.)

You can manage your addons either through the [command line interface](heroku-command) or through the the web console.
