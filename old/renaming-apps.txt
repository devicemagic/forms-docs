Renaming apps
=============

You can rename an app at any time with the `heroku rename` command. For example,
to rename an app named "oldname" to "newname", change into the app's git
checkout and run:

    :::term
    $ heroku rename newname
    http://newname.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:newname.git
    Git remote heroku updated

Renaming an app will cause it to immediately become available at the new
subdomain (`newname.heroku.com`) and unavailable at the old name
(`oldname.heroku.com`).  This may not matter if you're using a custom domain
name, but be aware that any external links will need to be updated.

## Renaming without a checkout

You can rename an app while outside a git checkout by passing an explicit
`--app` argument:

    :::term
    $ heroku rename newname --app oldname
    http://newname.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:newname.git

Note that you will need to manually update any existing git remotes that point
to the old name.

## Manually updating a Git remote

If you are inside the Git checkout directory, your remote will be updated
automatically. Other checkouts, such as those belonging to other
developers, will need to be updated manually:

    :::term
    $ git remote rm heroku
    $ git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:newname.git

Replace "newname" with the new name of the app, as specified in the rename
command.

NOTE: You can see all remotes and the git URLs they reference by typing `git
remote -v`.  You can also see and edit the full details for all remotes in your
current git repo by editing the file `.git/config`.
