# Billing on Heroku

## Overview

Basic usage of Heroku is free.  When you first sign up for your account, you have access to 1 dyno and a 5MB database.  From there, you can extend your application with add-ons from our [catalog](http://addons.heroku.com).  Use of any add-on requires that we first verify your account, in order to prevent abuse.   

Verification is completely free, and we will never charge your card until you explicitly confirm that it is OK to do so.

To use paid features such as some add-ons, additional dynos or workers, you must confirm that we may charge you.  This step ensures that it is OK to start charging the credit card on file.  

You only need to verify & confirm your account once, no matter how many apps you have.

NOTE: If you aren't yet verified, and select a paid resource or add-on, you will perform both steps at the same time.

## Verification

Account verification lets you use any of our free add-ons, and gives you access to turn on paid services any time with a few easy clicks. You only need to verify once per account. The easiest way to do this is to go straight to [http://heroku.com/verify](http://heroku.com/verify).

Alternatively, when you attempt to perform an action that requires verification, either from our CLI gem or through the web interface, you will be prompted to visit the verification page.

NOTE: You may see a $1 charge appear temporarily on your credit card statement. This charge is merely an authorization, and should disappear within a few days.

## Confirmation

Before we ever start charing your card, you must confirm that you agree to be billed.  You may confirm at any time by visiting [http://heroku.com/confirm](http://heroku.com/confirm).  

Alternatively, the first time you attempt to add any paid feature, Heroku will ask you to explicitly confirm your billing details and your agreement to be charged on a monthly basis.  

From the command line, you will see:
    :::term
    Adding bundles:unlimited to sushi... 
    This action will cause your account to be billed at the end of the month
    Are you sure you want to do this? (y/n)
and from the web UI, you will see:
