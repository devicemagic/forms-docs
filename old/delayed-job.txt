Delayed Job (DJ)
===========

Heroku makes it easy to use DJ in your application.  You can read more about how [background jobs work](background-jobs).  There are two steps to using DJ: the first is to configure your application to use it, and the second is to run one or more worker processes in your app.

Initial application setup
-------------------------

[Delayed Job][gh], also known as DJ, is a queueing system for Rails written
by Tobias Lütke of Shopify. It stores jobs in a table named `delayed_jobs`
in your app's database.

To use, install the DJ plugin in your Rails app:

    :::term
    $ script/plugin install git://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job.git

Create a database migration for the delayed_jobs table:

    :::term
    $ script/generate migration create_delayed_jobs

Edit the created migration to contain:

    :::ruby
    class CreateDelayedJobs < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def self.up
        create_table :delayed_jobs, :force => true do |table|
          table.integer  :priority, :default => 0      # jobs can jump to the front of
          table.integer  :attempts, :default => 0      # retries, but still fail eventually
          table.text     :handler                      # YAML object dump
          table.text     :last_error                   # last failure
          table.datetime :run_at                       # schedule for later
          table.datetime :locked_at                    # set when client working this job
          table.datetime :failed_at                    # set when all retries have failed
          table.text     :locked_by                    # who is working on this object
          table.timestamps
        end
      end
      def self.down
        drop_table :delayed_jobs
      end
    end

Run your migrations, and now you're ready to put something in your queue.
(John Nunemaker has an [excellent tutorial][tt] that goes into more detail
on setting up DJ.)

Continuing the feed example from the previous section, you might have a
class like this:

    :::ruby
    class Feed < ActiveRecord::Base
      def perform
        xml = RestClient.get url
        # ... do work to read and parse the feed and place it in the database
      end
    end

DJ can queue any object that responds to a `perform` method.  In this case,
calling `perform` will cause the feed to go out and fetch the latest info
from the URL, and store the results in the database. Now we can queue it
with this bit of code:

    :::ruby
    Delayed::Job.enqueue Feed.create!(:url => 'http://adam.blog.heroku.com/feed')

This returns immediately, as no work has been done yet. The job is now on
the queue, which you can see in your Rails console:

    :::ruby
    >> Delayed::Job.find(:first)
    => #<Delayed::Job id: 8, priority: 0, attempts: 0, handler: "--- !ruby/obj ...

The job won't execute until a worker process exists to consume it.  Start
the worker process like this:

    :::term
    $ rake jobs:work
    (in /home/adam/feedreader)
    *** Starting job worker host:silver pid:4227
    1 jobs processed at 7.0823 j/s, 0 failed ...

The worker process finds the job in queue, and performs it.  If you leave
this running and add more jobs to the queue, you'll see those jobs being
processed by the worker. Press `Ctrl-C` to exit when you no longer wish to
process jobs.

Running DJ workers on Heroku
----------------------------

Once your app uses DJ, you can start workers locally, or on a traditional host,
using `rake jobs:work`.  On Heroku, start your worker process via the heroku
workers command:

    :::term
    $ cd myapp
    $ heroku workers 1
    myapp is now running 1 worker

You can verify that the DJ process started without error by inspecting the
logs:

    :::term
    $ heroku logs
    ==> log/Dj-6.log <==
    (in /disk1/home/slugs/10818_59891ee_3440/mnt)
    *** Starting job worker host:railgun64.5985 pid:2476

Heroku will run and manage the number of worker processes you specify, and
you'll be billed to a prorated second, exactly like dynos.  You can increase or decrease
your workers as needed:

    :::term
    $ heroku workers +2
    myapp is now running 3 workers
    $ heroku workers -1
    myapp is now running 2 workers

To shut down all worker processes, set workers to zero:

    :::term
    $ heroku workers 0
    myapp is now running 0 workers
