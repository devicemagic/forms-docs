Rails 2.3.6 - 2.3.8
===================

This has now been replaced with [Gem Dependency](http://docs.heroku.com/gem-dependency)

On Sunday, May 23 2010 Rails 2.3.6 was released. Among the changes in this release is the move from Rack 1.0.1 to Rack 1.1.0. This change has been known to cause problems for some apps, specifically preventing them from starting.

If your Heroku app is affected, it may be displaying the following error:

    :::ruby
    Missing the Rails gem. Please `gem install -v= x.x.x`, update your
    RAILS_GEM_VERSION setting in config/environment.rb for the Rails version you do
    have installed, or comment out RAILS_GEM_VERSION to use the latest version
    installed.
    
Root Cause
----------

Rails encourages developers to pin their application to a specific Rails gem version through config/environment.rb. Versions 2.3.5 and older use Rack 1.0.1 and are incompatible with Rack 1.1.0, which is required by 2.3.6 and newer.

In addition to Rails itself, any gem required by your application may list its own set of dependencies. That way, when you install a gem, you will automatically get all _its_ required gems installed. For example, many gems written to be used in Rails apps may directly require some of Rails' underlying components such as [ActiveSupport](http://as.rubyonrails.org/) or [ActionPack](http://ap.rubyonrails.org/). Gem developers can require specific versions of these, or use syntax like ">2.2" - meaning that anything newer than version 2.2 will match.

For gems that depend on Rails or any of its subcomponents, and do not pin to version 2.3.5 or older (formtastic and hobofields for example), Rubygems will pick up the dependency and install the latest version of Rails (2.3.8 as of writing) _in addition_ to the older version of Rails specified in config/environment.rb. As part of this rather complex dependency resolution process, you will also get Rack 1.1.0 as Rails 2.3.6 and newer depend on it.

On Heroku we use [thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/) as the application server for your Ruby web apps. When it's time to start your app we'll automatically launch thin, which first loads Rack and subsequently your application code. By design, thin will pull in any available versions of Rack, including 1.1.0. Because Rails 2.3.5 and older are incompatible with Rack 1.1.0 your application will fail to start, displaying the error outlined above.

If you're debugging this issue locally, you can reproduce it by making sure you're using thin to launch your app on your workstation or test server. Here's how you start your app with thin:

    $ gem install thin
    $ cd myapp
    $ thin start


Resolution
----------

If you're seeing this error in your app, there are three possible routes for resolving it.

### Upgrade to Rails 2.3.8

Depending on your app's specific dependencies this could be extremely easy, or require a lot of work. The general steps are:

1. Add the Rails 2.3.8 gem to your gem manifest or Gemfile.
2. Change RAILS\_GEM\_VERSION to to 2.3.8 in config/environment.rb
3. Run rake rails:update locally
4. Review your application's dependencies
5. Commit and push to Heroku

### Use Bundler

If you're on the [Bamboo stack](http://docs.heroku.com/bamboo), you can use [Bundler](http://docs.heroku.com/bundler), which was designed to conclusively solve this type of dependency resolution problem. Do keep in mind that Bundler is still a beta-stage product that is evolving quickly with frequent new releases.

### Ignore dependencies for selected gems

If you suspect a particular gem is causing problems by requiring an unspecified version of actionpack or another component with a dependency on Rack, you can specify the "--ignore-dependencies" flag for that gem in your .gems manifest. This will tell rubygems not to load _any_ dependencies for that gem. Since you only want to ignore Rack, you will need to add other dependencies to your manifest. For example:
    
    formtastic --ignore-dependencies
    hobosupport
    hobofields --ignore-depedencies
    
You can inspect the dependencies for any gem with:

    $ gem dependency hobofields
    Gem hobofields-1.0.0
      hobosupport (= 1.0.0, runtime)
      rails (>= 2.2.2, runtime)
