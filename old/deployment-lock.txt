Deployment Lock
===============

Certain kinds of internal service interruptions can cause Heroku to switch on a deployment lock.  This protects traffic to paid applications for the duration of the interruption.

During a deployment lock, the following capabilities will be affected:

* Any commands through the Heroku command line client which create new processes or otherwise manipulate the internal application topography will be blocked.  For example, adding or removing dynos.
* Deployment via git push.
* Unpaid applications which have been put into an idle state cannot be woken up.

As a Heroku user, you need take no action; our team is hard at work resolving the interruption, and the lock will be released as soon as we're confident that everything is back to normal.
