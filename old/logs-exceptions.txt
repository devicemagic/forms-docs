Logs and exceptions
===================

Get the most recent logs for your app:

    :::term
    $ heroku logs
    Processing PlacesController#index (for 70.239.226.42 at 2008-11-03 17:28:18) [GET]
      Session ID: a6ed07bda83b889670e1841091d83c07
        Parameters: {"action"=>"index", "controller"=>"home"}
        Rendering template within layouts/application
        Rendering home/index
        Completed in 0.05659 (17 reqs/sec) | Rendering: 0.05293 (93%) | DB: 0.00000 (0%) | 200 OK [http://myapp.heroku.com/]

Accessing your logs is intended primarily for use in debugging a newly uploaded application that is producing unexpected results, such as an exception or a 500 / FAILSAFE error.  The logs displayed will be a jumble of results from the different servers your app happens to be running on, and will show only the most recent 100 lines.

If you have a site in production use by real users, use an external exception logging service.  We can recommend [Hoptoad](http://hoptoadapp.com/) and [Get Exceptional](http://getexceptional.com/).  Both of these services are very simple to set up on Heroku, and provide an easy and structured way to look at all your production exceptions.

You should not attempt to use the output of the `heroku logs` command for
metrics or usage analysis.  For that, we recommend [Google
Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics).
