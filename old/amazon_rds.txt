Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)
=================

[Amazon RDS](http://aws.amazon.com/rds) is a service that allows you to set up, operate and scale a dedicated MySQL database server on top of EC2. In addition to standard MySQL features, RDS offers the following functionality:

* Automated backups.
* Point-in-time recovery.
* Seamless vertical scaling between instance types.

The free Amazon RDS add-on lets you connect your Heroku app to an RDS instance and seamlessly use it in place of the standard, Heroku-provided PostgreSQL database.

Prerequisites
-------------------

Heroku does not operate RDS instances for you. Instead, we allow you connect to any running RDS instance that you control. To use the add-on, all you need is access to a database on an RDS instance.

Transferring Data
--------------------

If you are migrating from Heroku's built in PostgreSQL database to RDS, you may want to transfer database schema and data before switching over to RDS. To do this, you'll need to allow access to the RDS instance from your workstation. Here's how you authorize access, assuming your workstation's public IP is 1.1.1.1:

    :::term
    rds-authorize-db-security-group-ingress default --cidr-ip 1.1.1.1/32
    
Now you can use [taps](taps) to pull from your Heroku database to your RDS database:

    :::term
    heroku db:pull mysql://user:pass@rdshostname.amazonaws.com/databasename
    
Configuring the add-on
----------------------

Heroku needs to be able to access your RDS instance. To allow Heroku's cloud through your RDS firewall, run the following command:

    :::term
    rds-authorize-db-security-group-ingress default \
        --ec2-security-group-name default \
        --ec2-security-group-owner-id 098166147350
    
NOTE: If you have multiple RDS security groups, you can specify the desired group instead of "default".

NOTE: Your RDS instance will need to be in the us-east Amazon region to use Heroku's security group to control access.

Once authorized, you can add the add-on using the connection information for your database:

    :::term
    $ heroku addons:add amazon_rds url=mysql://user:pass@rdshostname.amazonaws.com/databasename
    Adding amazon_rds to appname...Done.
    
That's it! Your Heroku app should now be using your Amazon RDS database. If you check your config variables, you will see the DATABASE_URL changed:

    :::term
    $ heroku config
    DATABASE_URL => mysql://user:...zonaws.com/database

If you later on remove the add-on, you will automatically get a PostgreSQL database assigned.    

NOTE: If you did not transfer your database and schema, remember to run "heroku rake db:migrate" after you add the add-on.
