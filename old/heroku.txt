Introduction to Heroku
======================

Heroku is the instant ruby platform. Deploy any ruby app instantly with a simple
and familiar `git push`. Take advantage of advanced features like [HTTP
caching](http-caching), [memcached](memcached), [rack middleware](rack), and
instant scaling built into every app. Never think about hosting or servers
again.

### Multi-Tenant

Heroku is a multi-tenant platform and hosting environment. Your app doesn't need
its own servers, slices, or clusters, and you'll benefit from continuous
platform improvements.

### Fully Managed

Each element in this diagram represents a large pool of servers invisibly
managed by Heroku. Because we control all the infrastructure and software
layers, we can present a clean interface for deploying your code.

### Curation

We actively curate each layer, ensuring you have the latest in software and best
practices, and that it's all stable and integrated smoothly.

### Everything You Need

Together, these elements provide everything you need to run a modern,
high-performance, scalable web app. Click around to understand the path of a
request through the system.
