Getting Support
===============

We provide basic support free-of-charge to all our users, even those
who are not paying customers. We describe in detail what this means in
our [support policy](http://legal.heroku.com/support) If you are not a paying customer, we do ask
that you make sure that you've exhausted the freely available
resources and community channels before you contact support.

### Heroku Status

If you have questions about whether the Heroku service is experiencing
any issues, check out [Heroku Status](http://status.heroku.com)

### Docs

Our docs cover most of the basics as well as a number of important
advanced features and areas where there has been confusion.

### Web

We're lucky enough to have a very strong community of devs using our
platform, many of who help one another out. There's a bunch of great
articles, how-tos, and example apps available. Check them out when
you've hit a rough spot.

### Mailing List and IRC

We maintain the [Heroku mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/heroku/topics?gvc=2) (heroku@googlegroups.com).
In addition there's the <code>#heroku</code> channel on [irc.freenode.net](http://freenode.net) IRC for
people to hang out and trade questions and answers.

### Contacting Heroku Support

Heroku has a team of engineers dedicated to providing great support.
Our team's focus is investigating and solving new problems, getting
feedback on the service and in particular new features, and working
hard to improve the core service.

Contact our support engineers by [submitting a
ticket](http://support.heroku.com/requests/portal/new). Using the ticket system lets you communicate directly with
our support team, and receive email updates as soon as thereâ€™s
activity on your request. You can generally expect a response in a few
business days.

Heroku does provide higher levels of response time under contract to
paid customers. [Contact us](http://heroku.com/contact) for more information.
