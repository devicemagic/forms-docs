Connecting a Device
===================

To follow the steps below, you will need access to an Android, Blackberry or iPhone device (mobile phone/ tablet).

Below are steps for an Android smartphone, but the steps are identical on the various different platforms.

Inviting a Device
-----------------

To add a device, you will need to go to the “Devices” page.

If the device you wish to add has a valid email address, you can send it an invite to connect to your new organization. Alternatively, you can direct the device owner to download Device Magic’s Mobile Forms app from the relevant app store.

In a few minutes, the device should receive a new email. Open the email and follow the link to download the app.

The device will launch a download dialogue. Click on one of the links that will take you to an app store to start downloading. If you already have a version of the “Forms” app, it may ask if you wish to replace it.

Once the download is complete, open the app.

When the app starts up for the first time, you will be asked if you would like to join an existing organization or create a new one. If you created an organization when going through the earlier steps in this guide, select “Join Existing Organization”. If you did not, then click the Sign Up Free button and follow the prompts in the email you will receive.

If you are joining an existing organization you will be presented with the following registration screen:

Enter your full name and Organization Key.

NOTE: You can find your organization key in the invitation email or on your dashboard

Finally, click “Request Assignment”. The device will then attempt to contact our servers and join your organization. The account administrator (which could be you, if you are reading this) will receive an email to notify you that the device is awaiting your approval.

Switch back to the website. If you click “Devices”, the “Devices” page will refresh and you will see your device waiting to be assigned (if you don’t see anything, double check that you entered the Organization Key correctly on your device). Click “Approve”.

Now have a look at your mobile phone. If the application has not already moved past the “Requesting Assignment” screen, then click “Update”. The application should open and begin downloading forms.

Notice that the new form is starred to alert the user to its presence.
