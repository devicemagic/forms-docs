Publishing Your Form
=================

When you first create a new form, it is automatically published so it can be accessed by devices in the field.

If you would like to unpublish a form, all you need to do is switch the “Advanced View” UI (User Interface - the way you view the layout of the forms page) to “On”.

It will look like this:

![publish!](https://s3.amazonaws.com/docs_resources/Publishing+Your+Form+Images/Resized/Advanced+View+Resized.png)

You can then view the “drop-down” tab next to your form which will allow you to change it to “Unpublished”.

Let’s leave your Travel Log form on “Default” for now.
