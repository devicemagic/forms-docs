Devices API
===========

The devices API allows you to manipulate the devices of your organization. This is an XML API only (for now).

The API requires you to authenticate each call with your API token. Please see our [authentication topic](auth) if you need to know more.

Base URL
--------
The devices API is RESTful, operating on this base URL (note the HTTPS):
	:::term
	https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[org_id]/devices

where your [org_id] is the same ID in the URL when you're logged in and viewing your forms at www.devicemagic.com with your browser.

Querying your Devices
---------------------

To retrieve a list of the devices that are part of your organization, send an (authenticated) HTTP GET to:
	:::term
	HTTP GET https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[org_id]/devices.xml

Querying an Individual Device
-----------------------------

To retrieve the properties of a particular device in your organization, send an (authenticated) HTTP GET to:
	:::term
	HTTP GET https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[org_id]/devices/[device_id].xml

where the [device_id] is the numeric ID (e.g. 1234, not the string 'iPad / BlackBerry / Android _2234f33fe') of that device.

The return XML will look something like this:
	:::xml
	<device>
		<id>12345</id>
		<identifier>iPhone_abcdef1234567890</identifier>
		<organization-id>10</organization-id>
		<owner>iPhone 4S</owner>
		<description>Scratched, and dropped once or twice</description>
		<pending-approval>false</pending-approval>
		<groups>Default</groups>
	</device>

Approving a Device
------------------

You can approve devices for your organization that are pending approval via an authenticated HTTP POST to:
	:::term
	HTTP POST https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[org_id]/devices/[device_id]/approve
  
When you retrieve the XML for the devices (or a single device) for your organization, there's a <pending-approval> element (containing 'true' or 'false') that indicates whether a device has been approved.

Approving devices that are already approved has no effect.

Removing a Device from your Organization
----------------------------------------

Devices can be removed from your organization via an HTTP DELETE to that device's URL:
	:::term
	HTTP DELETE https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[org_id]/devices/[device_id]

Updating the Properties of a Device
-----------------------------------

An HTTP PUT to the device's URL will update the properties of the device.
	:::term
	HTTP PUT https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[org_id]/devices/[device_id]
The API allows you to update the owner, the description and the form groups to which the device belongs.

The request content of the PUT must be XML describing the changes you require. You'll need to set the Content-Type header of the request to application/xml. An example payload is below:
	:::xml
	<device>
		<owner>Andy Warhol</owner>
		<description>Eight Elvises</description>
		<groups>Default,Unpublished</groups>
	</device>

If you leave out any elements in the payload, those properties of the device will be left unchanged.

When you specify groups, provide a comma-separated list of group names. Please don't include spaces unless they're actually part of the group name.
