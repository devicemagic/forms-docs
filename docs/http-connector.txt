HTTP Connector
================

When you need more flexibility than a simple e-mail or Google Spreadsheet, use the HTTP Connector to receive data at a web endpoint you specify. For each form submission received by the Mobile Forms server, a corresponding XML payload including both the form data and some metadata will be delivered to the URI you specify. Please note that the HTTP Connector is only available with [Mobile Forms Advanced](http://www.devicemagic.com/pricing).

Using the "First Form" demo form as an example, this would be a corresponding XML payload:

### Example XML Payload
	:::xml
	<xml>
		<instance>
		</instance>
	</xml>


Once your server has finished processing the XML succesfully, return a 20X-series of HTTP response. 

NOTE: Any other response code will be interpreted as a failure by the Mobile Forms server and will continue to attempt delivery at periodic intervals.

In this way, downtime or communication difficulties between our servers won't result in lost data.

For diagnostics, please visit your "Delivery Problems" page from your organization's dashboard. Note that this link won't appear if there are no delivery problems for the various connectors you have configured.
