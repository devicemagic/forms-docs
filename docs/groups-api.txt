Groups API
==========

The groups API allows you to manage groups within your organization.

Each form is assigned to a group, and devices are members of (potentially multiple) groups. This means you can have certain forms only visible to certain devices.

(You may only want your "New Lead" form visible to your sales team, and while you're testing new form designs, you may only want those forms visible on test devices.)

This API allows you to create new groups.

If you're looking to manage the group a form belongs to, please see the [forms API](forms-api). 

If you're looking to organize a device's groups, please see the [devices API](devices-api).

The API requires you to authenticate each call with your API token. Please see our [authentication topic](auth) if you need to know more.

Base URL
--------
The groups API is RESTful, operating on this base URL (note the HTTPS):
	:::term
	https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[org_id]/groups

where your [org_id] is the same ID in the URL when you're logged in and viewing your forms at www.devicemagic.com with your browser.

Creating Groups
---------------

To create a group, you'll need to do an HTTP POST with the names of the groups you'd like to create to 
	:::term
	HTTP POST https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[org_id]/groups

Creating Groups via XML
-----------------------

If you'd like to create groups via XML, you'll need to set the content-type header:

	:::term
	Content-Type: application/xml

and your POST body will need to look like this:
	:::xml
	<groups>
		<group>
			<name>My New Group Name</name>
		</group>
	</groups>

You can specify multiple groups to create at the same time:
	:::xml
	<groups>
		<group>
			<name>A First Group</name>
		</group>
		<group>
			<name>A Second Group</name>
		</group>
	</groups>

Creating Groups via JSON
------------------------

If you prefer to use JSON, you'll need to set the content-type header:

	:::term
	Content-Type: application/json

and your POST body will need to look something like this:
	:::json
	[ "My New Group Name" ]

You can create multiple groups at the same time by providing additional names in your array:
	:::json
	[ "A First Group", "A Second Group" ]

Server Responses for Group Creation
-----------------------------------

If your groups were created, the server will respond with a 201 Created.

If no groups were changed, the server will respond with a 304 No Modified.

If there was a problem with a request, the server will respond with a 400 Bad Request. Check the 'Message' header in the response headers for the reason for the problem.
