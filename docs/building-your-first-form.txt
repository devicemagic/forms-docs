Building Your First Form
=========================

The Dashboard
-------------

Your organization’s dashboard gives you all the basic information you need to know to manage your organization and its forms. At a glance you can see how many forms you have in your account, and how many devices are connected that can view and submit these forms. A graph of the last month’s submissions is also included.

The right-hand blue box on the dashboard has a link to edit your account, as well as the very important organization key which your devices must supply when connecting to your organization.

Add a Form
----------

When your trial account is first configured, we’ll install some demo forms to get you started. Feel free to play around with these, copy them to serve as the basis of your own forms and so on.

To build your own form, click the “5 Forms” link or use the blue navigation bar on the upper part of the screen. This will take you to the forms working area.

Now click the “+ New Form” button.

You will then be redirected to the web-based form designer. The forms designer is where you create and edit your team’s forms.

On the top we have a row of buttons with options to save, discard, import/export your form. In the middle of the screen you will see a form surface area, or form field, where you can see edits and changes that you make to your form. The left-hand area of the screen is the Toolbox - a catalogue of fields you can include in your form. Lastly, to the right you will see the Properties box. In this box you can alter the contents of the selected form, field or repeat group.

Building a Travel Log Form
--------------------------

Just to get started, we will create a quick business travel log form. First, configure the title and description of the form, as this will aid your users in the field.

Now we can add the questions or fields for the information we want to capture. Questions can be added by dragging the type of question you need from the Toolbox on the left into place on the form surface area. Alternatively, simply click the item in the Toolbox. You can rearrange the order of the fields at any time by dragging them around the form surface area.

In our first question we will capture the date of the business trip.

Change the default question text from “Date Question” to “Trip Date”.

Next you will need to add the remaining questions to your form and specify their question texts.

Drag each field from the Toolbox onto your form field as below:
