Forms API
=========

The forms API allows you to manipulate the forms of your organization, either through XML or JSON.

The API requires you to authenticate each call with your API token. Please see our [authentication topic](auth) if you need to know more.

Base URL
--------
The forms API is RESTful, operating on this base URL (note the HTTPS):
	:::term
	https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[organization_id]/forms

where your [organization_id] is the same ID in the URL when you're logged in and viewing your forms at www.devicemagic.com with your browser.

Creating a new form
-------------------

To create a new form, you need to send an HTTP POST with the form definition to:
	:::term
	HTTP POST https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[organization_id]/forms

If you're providing an XML definition for the form, set the content type in the request headers to application/xml:
	:::term
	Content-Type: application/xml

And as the POST body provide the XML definition:
	:::xml
	<h:html
		xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms'
		xmlns:dm='http://www.devicemagic.com/XMLSchemaDataTypes'
		xmlns:ev='http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events'
		xmlns:h='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'
		xmlns:xsd='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'>
		<h:head>
			<h:title>Dummy Form</h:title>
			<model>
				<instance xmlns='http://www.devicemagic.com/xforms/dummy_form'>
					<untitled_form_1>
						<alpha/>
						<bravo/>
					</untitled_form_1>
				</instance>
			</model>
		</h:head>
		<h:body>
			<input ref='alpha'>
				<label>Alpha</label>
			</input>
			<input ref='bravo'>
				<label>Bravo</label>
			</input>
		</h:body>
	</h:html>

On success you'll receive a 201 Created, with a response body similar to this:
	:::xml
	<form>
		<id>42</id>
		<namespace>http://www.devicemagic.com/xforms/dummy_form</namespace>
		<name>Dummy Form</name>
	</form>

If the request fails, check the response header 'Message' for the reason. (Common issues include an invalid XML definition, or providing a namespace that is already in use.)

JSON forms work similarly. Send the POST to the same URL, with content type application/json:
	:::term
	HTTP POST https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[organization_id]/forms
	Content-Type: application/json

A JSON form definition as the POST body:
	:::json
	{
		"type": "root",
		"children": [
		{
			"identifier": "Free_Text_Question",
			"title": "Free Text Question",
			"autoIdentifier": true,
			"type": "text"
		},
		{
			"identifier": "Sketch_Question",
			"title": "Sketch Question",
			"autoIdentifier": true,
			"type": "sketch"
		} ],
		"title": "Dummy Form",
		"description": "Testing sample"
	}	

And the 201 Created on success will include a body like:
	:::json
	{
		"id": 129,
		"namespace": "http://www.devicemagic.com/xforms/dummy_sample",
		"name": "Test Form"
	}

As with the XML, check the response header 'Message' for reasons if the creation fails.

Updating an existing form
-------------------------

To update an existing form, you need to send an HTTP PUT with the form definition to:
	:::term
	HTTP PUT https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[organization_id]/forms/[form_id]

If you're providing an XML definition for the form, set the content type in the request headers to application/xml:
	:::term
	Content-Type: application/xml

And as the PUT body provide the updated XML definition:
	:::xml
	<h:html
		xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms'
		xmlns:dm='http://www.devicemagic.com/XMLSchemaDataTypes'
		xmlns:ev='http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events'
		xmlns:h='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'
		xmlns:xsd='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema'>
		<h:head>
			<h:title>Dummy Form</h:title>
			<model>
				<instance xmlns='http://www.devicemagic.com/xforms/dummy_form'>
					<untitled_form_1>
						<alpha/>
						<bravo/>
					</untitled_form_1>
				</instance>
			</model>
		</h:head>
		<h:body>
			<input ref='alpha'>
				<label>Alpha</label>
			</input>
			<input ref='bravo'>
				<label>Bravo</label>
			</input>
		</h:body>
	</h:html>

You need to use the same form namespace in the updated definition as was in the original.

On success you'll receive a 202 Accepted, with a response body similar to this:
	:::xml
	<form>
		<id>42</id>
		<namespace>http://www.devicemagic.com/xforms/dummy_form</namespace>
		<name>Dummy Form</name>
		<version>1.1</version>
	</form>

If the request fails, check the response header 'Message' for the reason.

JSON forms work similarly. Send the PUT to the same URL, with content type application/json:
	:::term
	HTTP PUT https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[organization_id]/forms/[form_id]
	Content-Type: application/json

A JSON form definition as the PUT body:
	:::json
	{
		"type": "root",
		"children": [
		{
			"identifier": "Free_Text_Question",
			"title": "Free Text Question",
			"autoIdentifier": true,
			"type": "text"
		},
		{
			"identifier": "Sketch_Question",
			"title": "Sketch Question",
			"autoIdentifier": true,
			"type": "sketch"
		} ],
		"title": "Dummy Form",
		"description": "Testing sample"
	}	

And the 202 Accepted on success will include a body like:
	:::json
	{
		"id": 129,
		"namespace": "http://www.devicemagic.com/xforms/dummy_sample",
		"name": "Test Form",
		"version": "1.1"
	}

As with the XML, check the response header 'Message' for reasons if the update fails.

Deleting a form
---------------

To delete a form, you need to send an HTTP DELETE to:
	:::term
	HTTP DELETE https://www.devicemagic.com/organizations/[organization_id]/forms/[form_id]

You'll receive a 200 OK if the delete succeeded, and an HTTP error response otherwise.
